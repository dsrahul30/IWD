===================================
 INTELLIGENT WATER DROPS ALGORITHM
===================================
Intelligent Water Drops algorithm, or the IWD algorithm, is a swarm-based nature-inspired optimization algorithm. This algorithm contains a few essential elements of natural water drops and actions and reactions that occur between river's bed and the water drops that flow within. The IWD algorithm may fall into the category of Swarm intelligence and Metaheuristic. Intrinsically, the IWD algorithm can be used for Combinatorial optimization. However, it may be adapted for continuous optimization too. The IWD was first introduced for the traveling salesman problem in 2007.

INSTALLATION
============

Download the Package manually and Install using:

	python setup.py install
